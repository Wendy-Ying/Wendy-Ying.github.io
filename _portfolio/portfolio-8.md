This project successfully designed and implemented a smart combination lock system featuring encryption-supported password management, anti-brute force protection, and remote monitoring via Bluetooth and sound alarms, enhancing security and user interaction. The system, developed using VHDL and tested through simulation and real-world experiments, reliably verifies passwords and triggers alarms for unauthorized access attempts, demonstrating robustness and practicality.
