In this study, an electronic ceramic ocarina based on ESP32 was successfully constructed, which incorporates advanced technologies such as airflow sensing, mechanical key input, audio processing and Bluetooth MIDI communication. Through precise circuit design and software development, this electronic ceramic ocarina not only realizes the digital simulation of traditional musical instruments, but also seamlessly integrates with modern music production environments through Bluetooth technology.
