This project has successfully developed an indoor positioning visual gimbal robot vehicle based on UWB devices and a ROS control system, achieving automatic navigation to target points by implementing technologies such as coordinate input from an upper computer, wireless serial communication, UWB positioning, A* path planning, and stepper motor control of the vehicle driven by STM32.
