This project successfully developed an image scaling system based on the seam-carving algorithm, which supports content-aware image resizing for both reduction and expansion, ensuring the results appear harmonious. Additionally, the system features a highly responsive and user-friendly GUI that allows users to protect or suggest deletion of specific image areas through interactive drawing.
