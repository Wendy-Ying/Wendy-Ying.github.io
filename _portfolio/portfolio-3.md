This project successfully developed an integrated system for a robotic manipulator to perform efficient path planning and precise object grasping in complex, dynamic environments. By integrating three core components—perception, motion planning, and control—the system utilizes ArUco markers for perception, RRT* algorithm and cubic spline optimization for near-optimal path planning, and PID and EMA control strategies to ensure accurate motion execution, demonstrating high accuracy and adaptability in real-world scenarios.
