Develop fully automated mission-oriented quadrotor UAV and wheeled vehicle for air-ground cooperative system. Realize various visual perception systems based on OpenCV, YOLO and OpenMV for classification, recognition, and localization tasks. Achieve wheeled vehicle path planning and control system using UWB, STM32 and stepper motor. Implement interactive ground station interface and establish a robust communication system among different modules.
