The development of a robotic navigation system was successfully achieved, utilizing a 2D LiDAR for precise positioning and navigation. An advanced filtering algorithm was integrated to significantly enhance the robot's capability to accurately recognize and access poles. Additionally, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology was employed to create a comprehensive map of the environment, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of the navigation system. The move_base framework was leveraged for global path planning and navigation, enabling the robot to efficiently traverse the designated course.
