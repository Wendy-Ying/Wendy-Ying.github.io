Hi, there! üëã Welcome to Yiwen Ying's Homepage.

I am a final year student at <a href='https://rcvlab.eee.sustech.edu.cn/'>Robot and Computer Vision Lab</a>, from the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering in <a href='https://www.sustech.edu.cn'>**Southern University of Science and Technology**</a>, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J7UkpAIAAAAJ'>Professor Hong Zhang</a>.

My research interests focus on **learning-based robot motion planning**. Have comprehensive capabilities in full-stack robotics development including perception, planning and control, with expertise in the field of motion planning, SLAM, machine learning, and computer vision. My programming expertise spans Python, C++, and MATLAB.

My personal CV is attached <a href='/files/resume.pdf'>here</a>. If you are interested in my research or have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href='mailto:yingyw2022@mail.sustech.edu.cn'>yingyw2022@mail.sustech.edu.cn</a>.
